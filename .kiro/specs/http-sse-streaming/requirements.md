# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds HTTP Server-Sent Events (SSE) streaming support to libchatty, enabling real-time token-by-token response streaming from LLM providers. This will allow applications to display partial responses as they arrive, improving user experience for interactive applications while maintaining libchatty's performance-first philosophy.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using libchatty, I want to receive streaming responses from LLM providers, so that I can display partial responses in real-time to improve user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user enables streaming mode THEN the system SHALL send `"stream": true` in the API request
2. WHEN streaming is enabled THEN the system SHALL process Server-Sent Events (SSE) from the HTTP response
3. WHEN a streaming chunk arrives THEN the system SHALL parse the JSON delta and invoke a user-provided callback function
4. WHEN the stream ends THEN the system SHALL invoke the callback with a completion indicator
5. WHEN streaming fails THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error handling and fallback to non-streaming mode

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simple callback-based API for handling streaming responses, so that I can easily integrate streaming into my application without complex event handling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user provides a callback function THEN the system SHALL call it for each token/chunk received
2. WHEN the callback is invoked THEN it SHALL receive the partial text content and completion status
3. WHEN the user doesn't provide a callback THEN the system SHALL fall back to non-streaming behavior
4. WHEN the callback returns an error THEN the system SHALL stop streaming and return the error

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want streaming support to work with all existing LLM providers, so that I can use streaming consistently across different APIs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN streaming is used with any supported provider THEN it SHALL work without provider-specific code changes
2. WHEN a provider doesn't support streaming THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to non-streaming mode
3. WHEN streaming is enabled THEN it SHALL maintain the same authentication and error handling as non-streaming requests
4. WHEN streaming is used THEN it SHALL not break existing non-streaming functionality

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want streaming to maintain libchatty's performance characteristics, so that streaming doesn't compromise the library's speed advantage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN streaming is used THEN memory usage SHALL remain minimal and bounded
2. WHEN streaming processes chunks THEN it SHALL not introduce significant CPU overhead
3. WHEN streaming is disabled THEN performance SHALL be identical to current implementation
4. WHEN streaming buffers data THEN it SHALL use efficient memory management without leaks
