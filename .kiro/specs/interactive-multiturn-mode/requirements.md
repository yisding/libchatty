# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds an interactive/multiturn conversation mode to the chatty demo application, allowing users to have ongoing conversations with LLM providers instead of single request-response interactions. The current CLI application only supports one-shot queries, but users need the ability to maintain conversation context across multiple exchanges for more natural interactions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the chatty CLI, I want to enter an interactive mode where I can have a continuous conversation with the LLM, so that I can maintain context across multiple exchanges without restarting the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs the chatty CLI without providing a message argument THEN the system SHALL enter interactive mode
2. WHEN the user runs the chatty CLI with the -i flag and a message THEN the system SHALL send the initial message and enter interactive mode for continued conversation
3. WHEN in interactive mode THEN the system SHALL display a prompt indicating it's ready for user input
4. WHEN the user enters a message in interactive mode THEN the system SHALL send the message to the LLM and display the response
5. WHEN the user enters another message THEN the system SHALL include the previous conversation history in the API request to maintain context
6. WHEN the user wants to exit interactive mode THEN the system SHALL accept Ctrl+C, Ctrl+D (twice), or "/quit" command to terminate gracefully

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the interactive mode to maintain conversation history, so that the LLM can reference previous messages and provide contextually relevant responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a conversation starts THEN the system SHALL initialize an empty conversation history
2. WHEN the user sends a message THEN the system SHALL add the user message to the conversation history
3. WHEN the LLM responds THEN the system SHALL add the assistant response to the conversation history
4. WHEN sending subsequent requests THEN the system SHALL include all previous messages in the API payload
5. IF the conversation history becomes too long THEN the system SHALL implement a reasonable limit to prevent API token limits from being exceeded

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user of the interactive mode, I want clear visual indicators and prompts, so that I understand when the system is ready for input and can distinguish between my messages and the LLM responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN entering interactive mode THEN the system SHALL display a welcome message explaining how to use the mode
2. WHEN waiting for user input THEN the system SHALL display a clear prompt (e.g., "You: ")
3. WHEN displaying LLM responses THEN the system SHALL prefix them with a clear indicator (e.g., "Assistant: ")
4. WHEN the system is processing a request THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback that it's working
5. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL display the error message and continue accepting input rather than exiting

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the interactive mode to be compatible with all existing provider configurations, so that I can use any supported LLM provider in conversation mode.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using interactive mode THEN the system SHALL respect all existing environment variables for API configuration
2. WHEN using interactive mode with different providers THEN the system SHALL work with OpenAI, Groq, Fireworks AI, Mistral AI, Hyperbolic, DeepSeek, and Llama API
3. WHEN switching between providers THEN the system SHALL maintain the same interactive interface regardless of the backend
4. WHEN provider-specific errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully and allow the conversation to continue

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer on different platforms, I want the interactive mode to be optional during build, so that the application can still be built and used in non-interactive mode even if notcurses is not available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN notcurses is available during build THEN the system SHALL compile with full interactive mode support
2. WHEN notcurses is not available during build THEN the system SHALL compile without interactive mode but retain all other functionality
3. WHEN running the application without interactive mode support THEN the system SHALL display a helpful message if interactive mode is requested
4. WHEN building on different platforms THEN the system SHALL automatically detect notcurses availability and configure accordingly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a performance-conscious developer, I want the interactive mode to maintain the library's performance characteristics, so that conversation responses remain fast even with maintained context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using interactive mode THEN the system SHALL maintain sub-second response times for typical conversations
2. WHEN conversation history grows THEN the system SHALL not significantly degrade performance
3. WHEN memory usage increases with conversation length THEN the system SHALL implement reasonable bounds to prevent excessive memory consumption
4. WHEN handling multiple rapid inputs THEN the system SHALL process them efficiently without blocking
