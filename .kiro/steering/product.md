# Product Overview

libchatty is a high-performance ChatGPT wrapper library written in C, designed for developers who prioritize speed and minimal resource usage ("ricers"). 

## Core Value Proposition
- **Performance-first**: 212x faster than LlamaIndex, 40x faster than LangChain, 20x faster than LITS
- **Minimal footprint**: Low memory usage and CPU overhead
- **Multi-provider support**: Works with OpenAI, Groq, Fireworks AI, Mistral AI, Hyperbolic, DeepSeek, and Llama API
- **Simple API**: Clean C interface for chat completions

## Target Audience
Developers who need blazing fast LLM API calls without the overhead of Python/JavaScript frameworks. Ideal for performance-critical applications, embedded systems, or high-throughput scenarios.

## Philosophy
This is a lightweight, focused library that does one thing well: fast LLM API calls. It's not a comprehensive RAG framework - it's for "AI Engineering chads" who want speed over features.
